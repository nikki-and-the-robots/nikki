Thank you for coming here, Nikki!
The organization is exceedingly worried about the suspicious activities around Dr. Lacroix and his robots...
So far none of the others returned from the investigations...
And now you are my only hope!
Start with your secret mission a few blocks to the right from here in Dr. Lacroix's secret ground facility.
I'll wait for you there!
And don't forget, you can move using $leftKey and $rightKey...
...with $jumpKey you can jump
...and use $contextKey for talking to other characters.
By the way, you can always take a break by pressing ESC.
Good luck, Nikki!
